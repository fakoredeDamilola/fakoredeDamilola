## Fakorede Damilola

hi, my name is Damilola and I am a web developer. As a full stack web developer, I love and specialize in building easy to use products.
I put myself in place of the user and I don't make assumptions. I personally believe this is one of the key things that make a website awesome and this is what I hope to achieve with every product I build. I don't assume the user should know it is a button when I don't put a pointer cursor and I definitely would not assume that they should know a button is disabled when I don't give it a disabled cursor when they hover.

I am currently working on clones of products I love like udemy etc

I read articles mostly and watch a few YouTube videos on how to improve my skills which are listed below. 

I am looking to collaborate on any fullstak or blockchain project. I hope to learn and also contribute my own quota diligently

I am passionate about tech and I am always looking forward to learn as much as I can, tech and non-tech related .

I would love to network with new people, work and also learn from others.
I work mostly but not limited to
JavaScript, 
Typescript
React,
NextJS,
MongoDB,
web3,
etherJS
ChakraUI

Let's connect
