## Fakorede Damilola

I am a fullstack(MERN) web developer who loves to create impactful brands and products.

As I've grown as a developer, I have built awesome projects which have opened my eyes to what is expected of any web application.

Through these experiences, I've built memorable products that are not only enjoyable to use, but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand.

I started my coding journey with dreamweaver, but I felt there was more to programming, I wanted to feel that speed typing I always saw people do on television, and that led me to become better and more passionate about programming.
